## [[dmux]] - Parallel Agents with tmux and Worktrees

Dev agent multiplexer by Justin Schroeder (@jpschroeder) and Boyd (@0xboyd) from FormKit team. Runs multiple AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) in parallel using tmux and git worktrees. Each agent gets its own isolated working copy — no conflicts. Press `n` to create pane, type prompt, pick agent; dmux creates worktree, launches agent. Press `m` to merge back when done. Key features: A/B agent pairs (run two agents on same prompt side-by-side, pick winner), AI-powered branch names and commit messages via OpenRouter (gpt-4o-mini/grok-4-fast), smart two-phase merging (merge main→worktree first to resolve conflicts in isolation), 11 lifecycle hooks with AI-assisted authoring (press `h`), multi-project support (frontend+backend in same session), autopilot mode for full autonomy. Built as internal tool for running "Codex and Claude Code swarms" and open-sourced. MIT license. Install: `npm install -g dmux`
