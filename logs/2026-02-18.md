## [[tambo-ai]] - Generative UI SDK for React

Open-source React toolkit (MIT) for building agents that render UI. Register components with Zod schemas — the agent picks the right one and streams props directly to it. "Show me sales by region" renders your `<Chart>`. "Add a task" updates your `<TaskBoard>`. Two component types: generative (render once — charts, summaries) and interactable (persist and update as users refine — shopping carts, task boards). Fullstack: includes agent loop (bring your own OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini key), streaming infrastructure with error recovery, full MCP support, local browser-side tools, and Tambo Cloud or self-hosted backend. v1.0 just launched. Positioned against Vercel AI SDK, CopilotKit, and Assistant UI — key differentiator is AI-driven component selection and persistent stateful components.

## [[larry-tiktok-skill]] - TikTok Marketing Automation Skill on ClawHub

OpenClaw skill by OliverHenry (@OllieWazza) that automates the full TikTok slideshow marketing pipeline for apps/products. Proven results per SKILL.md: 7M views on viral X article, 1M+ TikTok views, $670/month MRR. Pipeline: competitor research → AI image generation (OpenAI gpt-image-1.5) → text overlays via node-canvas → post as draft via Postiz (user manually adds trending music) → daily analytics cron cross-referencing Postiz views with RevenueCat conversions. Diagnoses funnel breakdowns: hook? CTA? app onboarding? Interesting security note: VirusTotal says benign but OpenClaw flags as suspicious (handles many API keys).

## [[mockdown.design]] - ASCII Wireframe Editor for AI-Assisted Coding

Browser-based ASCII wireframe editor by Mike Bespalov (@bbssppllvv, founder of Refero, 250K users). Sketch UI layouts using 20+ text components (buttons, tables, nav bars, modals, etc.), export as Markdown, paste into Claude Code or Cursor. The key insight: AI reads a Markdown wireframe faster and more accurately than a verbal description of a layout. Free, no account, works offline, wireframes stay on device.

Why it matters for AI coding: built explicitly for human-to-AI communication, not just human-to-human. "One wireframe replaces a page of instructions." Also solves the portability problem of visual wireframe tools — ASCII paste into GitHub issues, Slack, and code comments without broken image links.
