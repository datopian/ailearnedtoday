## What Is It

A collection of 10 role-play AI prompts specifically designed for Claude Opus 4.6 to generate professional design work. The prompts instruct the AI to act as designers at prestigious companies (Apple, Pentagram) and produce design systems, brand identities, and UI/UX patterns.

## Example Prompts (from thread)

### PROMPT 1: The Design System Architect

> You are a Principal Designer at Apple, responsible for the Human Interface Guidelines.
>
> Create a comprehensive design system for [BRAND/PRODUCT NAME].
>
> Brand attributes:
> - Personality: [MINIMALIST/BOLD/PLAYFUL/PROFESSIONAL/LUXURY]
> - Primary [...]

### PROMPT 2: The Brand Identity Creator

> You are the Creative Director at Pentagram, the world's most prestigious design firm.
>
> Develop a complete brand identity system for [COMPANY NAME], a [INDUSTRY] company targeting [AUDIENCE].
>
> Brand strategy foundation:
> - Mission: [STATEMENT] [...]

### PROMPT 3: The UI/UX Pattern Master

> You are a Senior UI Designer at Apple, [...]

## Approach

The prompts use **role-play framing** — instructing the AI to assume the identity and expertise of professionals at Apple, Pentagram, and other prestigious design firms. This priming technique is intended to elevate the quality and consistency of the AI's output by anchoring it to well-known design standards.

Each prompt is structured as a template with placeholders for customization:
- [BRAND/PRODUCT NAME]
- [INDUSTRY]
- [AUDIENCE]
- [MINIMALIST/BOLD/PLAYFUL/PROFESSIONAL/LUXURY]

## Claimed Results

- **Complete design systems** in ~6 hours
- **Brand guidelines**
- **47+ marketing assets**

## Why It Matters

### For Designers
These prompts represent a systematized approach to using AI for design work — not ad-hoc prompting, but structured role-play templates that can be reused across projects. The focus on Claude Opus 4.6 specifically suggests this version may have particular strengths for design tasks.

### For AI Prompting
This is an example of **prompt engineering for creative fields**. The technique of having AI role-play as experts from known institutions (Apple HIG, Pentagram) is a form of context priming that can improve output quality — though results will vary based on how well the AI's training data covers those institutions' actual design practices.

### Limitations
- **Role-play ≠ expertise**: The AI doesn't have actual Apple or Pentagram design experience; it's pattern-matching from training data
- **Template quality varies**: Effectiveness depends on how well the user fills in the placeholders
- **"47+ marketing assets in 6 hours"**: Likely includes significant AI generation, which may require human review and refinement
