## [[harness-engineering-openai]] - Building Software with 0 Lines of Human-Written Code

OpenAI's Codex team built a real internal product (hundreds of daily users, external alpha testers) with a team of 3–7 engineers writing zero lines of code by hand. Everything — app logic, tests, CI, docs, observability — written by Codex. Result: ~1M lines of code, ~1,500 PRs in 5 months, 3.5 PRs/engineer/day, estimated 1/10th the time to build manually.

Key lessons: (1) AGENTS.md should be a 100-line map, not a 1,000-page manual — point to a structured `docs/` directory as system of record; (2) anything not in the repo doesn't exist for the agent — Slack discussions, Google Docs, people's heads are all inaccessible; (3) make the *app itself* legible to the agent (Chrome DevTools Protocol, per-worktree observability with LogQL/PromQL); (4) strict architecture enforced by custom linters is the *prerequisite* for agent velocity, not something you add later; (5) continuous "garbage collection" via background Codex cleanup agents beats weekly "AI slop" cleanup sessions (they tried Friday cleanup, it didn't scale).

Key quote: "Building software still demands discipline, but the discipline shows up more in the scaffolding rather than the code."
