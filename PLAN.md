Maybe also a circular one for e.g. substack profile. **✅2026-01-12 have a half-decent logo. somehow couldn't quite get what i wanted with AI.**

- [x] ➕2026-01-12 Another pattern re AI development: I often want this kind of design experimentation at the beginning e.g. to create landing page and look and feel. Or i want to do marketing and product research, and have a whole bunch of materials. So I want a place to store this stuff, but I don't want to pollute the main part of the repo. I guess I could do this in a branch in the repo for the project. Or I have a pattern with actually having a separate repo with a prefix like design- the name of the project. **✅2026-01-12 posted at https://aitriedtoday.substack.com/p/how-do-you-handle-the-pre-work-phase**
