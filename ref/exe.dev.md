# exe.dev

**A VM service designed for agents. Start fresh VMs, run unconstrained agents, turn one-liners into programs.**

## Links

- **Website:** https://exe.dev

## Overview

exe.dev is being built by David Crawshaw (author of [[crawshaw-eight-more-months-agents]]) to solve the problem of running agents in the cloud.

## The Problem It Solves

When working with agents:
- Built-in sandboxes don't work (constant permission prompts)
- You need to turn off sandbox and provide your own
- Fresh VMs are the best solution
- But clouds are "the worst product" in this new agent-driven world

## The Vision

> "I need a VM, with an unconstrained agent, that I can trivially start up and type the one liner I would have otherwise put into an Apple Note named TODO and forgotten about."

**Agent:** "Shelley" - turns one-liners into useful programs

## Philosophy

> "The entire point of the product is you should never feel that your agent should rewrite part of it for you."

Build infrastructure that agents love to use, because every customer will have an agent interacting with your product.

## Context

From his article: "A good portion of the time Shelley turns a one-liner into a useful program. I am having more fun programming than I ever have, because so many more of the programs I wish I could find the time to write actually exist."

Donated the pi.dev domain to Mario Zechner for the [[pi.dev]] coding agent.
