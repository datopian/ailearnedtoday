I'm a bit bewildered there's so many options. Which do you use and why?

- [codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)
- [claude](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)
- [gemini](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
- [amp](https://ampcode.com)
- [opencode](https://opencode.ai)

No doubt many more.

One answer is that I already find myself switching between Claude, Codex, and Gemini myself in the command line due to limits, running out of tokens, whatever.
