## [[whizz-ai-design-prompts]] - AI Prompts for Claude Opus 4.6

Hamza Khalid (@Whizz_ai) shared 10 role-play AI prompts for Claude Opus 4.6 that generate professional design work by having the AI act as designers at Apple (Principal Designer for HIG), Pentagram (Creative Director), etc. Claims to produce complete design systems, brand guidelines, and 47+ marketing assets in ~6 hours using template prompts with placeholders.

## [[dmux]] - Parallel Agents with tmux and Worktrees

Dev agent multiplexer by Justin Schroeder (@jpschroeder) and Boyd (@0xboyd) from FormKit team. Runs multiple AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) in parallel using tmux and git worktrees. Each agent gets its own isolated working copy — no conflicts. Press `n` to create pane, type prompt, pick agent; dmux creates worktree, launches agent. Press `m` to merge back when done. Key features: A/B agent pairs (run two agents on same prompt side-by-side, pick winner), AI-powered branch names and commit messages via OpenRouter (gpt-4o-mini/grok-4-fast), smart two-phase merging (merge main→worktree first to resolve conflicts in isolation), 11 lifecycle hooks with AI-assisted authoring (press `h`), multi-project support (frontend+backend in same session), autopilot mode for full autonomy. Built as internal tool for running "Codex and Claude Code swarms" and open-sourced. MIT license. Install: `npm install -g dmux`
