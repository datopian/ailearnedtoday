# Conductor

**Run a team of coding agents on your Mac.**

## What Is It?

Conductor is a Mac app that lets you run parallel Claude Code and Codex agents in isolated workspaces. You can see at a glance what they're working on, then review and merge their changes.

## Why Curated

Simple, dev-oriented site with a cool pixel/dot-matrix logo, elegant layout, and solid overall design. Clean and purposeful — the kind of site that lets the product speak.

## Trusted By

Linear, Vercel, Notion, Stripe, Life360, BlackSmith, Reducto, Tigrs

## How It Works

1. **Add your repo** — Conductor clones it and works entirely on your Mac
2. **Deploy agents** — Each Claude Code you spin up gets an isolated workspace
3. **Conduct** — See who's working, what needs attention, and review code

## Notes

- Built by Melty Labs
- Uses Claude Code (and Codex); works with your existing Claude Pro/Max login
- Each agent workspace is a new git worktree
