## [[crawshaw-eight-more-months-agents]] - Agent Programming Year in Review

David Crawshaw (building [[exe.dev]]) reflects on a year of coding with agents. Key takeaway: models improved from writing 1/4 to 9/10 of his code, IDEs are waning (back to Vi), frontier models are essential, and software needs to change shape. "By far the worst product I had to use every day in this new world were clouds, so that's what I'm building over at exe.dev." New philosophy: build what programmers love because every customer has an agent.

## [[openspec.dev]] - Spec-Driven Framework for AI Agents
