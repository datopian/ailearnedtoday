# Mockdown — ASCII Wireframe Editor

> Wireframes that live in plain text. Sketch a UI in minutes, export as Markdown, paste into Claude Code or Cursor. AI reads a wireframe faster than your explanation. 20+ components, zero setup.

## What Is It

Mockdown is a browser-based ASCII wireframe editor that lets you sketch UI layouts using text-based components and export them as clean Markdown. The key insight: AI coding tools read Markdown wireframes better than verbal descriptions of layouts.

Free, no account required, no installation, works offline. Wireframes stay on your device.

## What Problem Does It Solve

Describing a UI layout to an AI is painful and imprecise:

> "Put a search bar on the left, a table below, pagination at the bottom..."

With Mockdown you just:
1. Sketch the screen in Mockdown
2. Click "Copy Markdown"
3. Paste into Claude Code, Cursor, or Copilot
4. Get working code back

"One wireframe replaces a page of instructions."

It also solves the **format portability problem** of visual wireframe tools: ASCII wireframes paste into GitHub issues, Slack messages, code comments, and Notion pages without broken image links or export friction.

## Key Features

### 20+ Built-in Components

**Form controls**: Button, Input, Dropdown, Search, Checkbox, Radio, Toggle, Progress bar

**Navigation**: Nav Bar, Tabs, Breadcrumb, Pagination

**Containers**: Card, Dialog/Modal

**Data**: Table (with headers and rows)

**Drawing**: Lines, Arrows, Freehand Pencil, Brush, Spray, Boxes, Placeholders, Split panels, Text blocks, Lists

### Editor Capabilities
- Drag to place components, double-click any text to edit inline
- Components resize to fit content
- **Generate** button (AI generation feature)
- Undo/Redo, Clear Canvas, Toggle Grid Lines, Dark Mode
- 80×40 character canvas
- **Copy Markdown** — one click exports the full wireframe as plain text

### Why Plain Text?
- Paste into GitHub issues, Slack, code commits — no screenshots, no broken image links
- Commits with your code (wireframes are version-controllable)
- "No screenshots. No broken image links. No 'can you export that as PNG?'"

### Why Lo-fi?
- "Text wireframes keep the conversation on structure, not color"
- Faster feedback: "Five layout options in ten minutes"
- No time wasted polishing pixels before the layout is validated

## Who Built It

## Why It Matters

### AI-Native Workflow
Mockdown is explicitly designed for the AI-assisted coding era. Most wireframe tools were built for human-to-human communication; Mockdown is built for human-to-AI communication. The Markdown output is structured for LLM consumption, not just visual clarity.

### Target Users
- **Developers**: Sketch a login form in a code comment before writing the first line of JSX
- **Product Managers**: Show a layout idea in a Jira ticket — immediately, not next sprint
- **Designers**: Explore 5 layout options in 10 minutes before opening Figma
- **Technical Writers**: Embed UI diagrams in docs that survive every format conversion

### The Shift from Visual to Textual Prototyping
Tools like Figma are optimized for high-fidelity visual design. Mockdown is optimized for the idea phase — when you need to communicate structure quickly to both humans and AI systems. It occupies the space between a napkin sketch and a proper wireframe tool.
