## [[mockdown.design]] - ASCII Wireframe Editor for AI-Assisted Coding

Browser-based ASCII wireframe editor by Mike Bespalov (@bbssppllvv, founder of Refero, 250K users). Sketch UI layouts using 20+ text components (buttons, tables, nav bars, modals, etc.), export as Markdown, paste into Claude Code or Cursor. The key insight: AI reads a Markdown wireframe faster and more accurately than a verbal description of a layout. Free, no account, works offline, wireframes stay on device.

Why it matters for AI coding: built explicitly for human-to-AI communication, not just human-to-human. "One wireframe replaces a page of instructions." Also solves the portability problem of visual wireframe tools — ASCII paste into GitHub issues, Slack, and code comments without broken image links.
