**Summary**: Cognitive debt is the mental burden and loss of understanding that accumulates when developers use AI to generate code without fully comprehending it. Unlike technical debt (which lives in code), cognitive debt lives in developers' brains and affects their ability to reason about and confidently modify systems. Margaret-Anne Storey describes a student team that "accumulated cognitive debt faster than technical debt" and became paralyzed, unable to make even simple changes. Simon Willison reflects on his own "vibe coding" experiments: "I no longer have a firm mental model of what they can do and how they work, which means each additional feature becomes harder to reason about."

**Why it matters**: Challenges the "move fast" approach enabled by AI agents. Even if AI generates clean code, developers who don't understand their own systems lose agency, face feature paralysis, and struggle with debugging. For teams, shared understanding evaporates when different members use AI to generate different parts of the system. This suggests code review and comprehension remain essential even with AI assistance - speed without understanding has a hidden cost.
