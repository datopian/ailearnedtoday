## [[github-spec-kit]] - GitHub's Spec-Driven Development Toolkit

GitHub's open source toolkit for Spec-Driven Development. 6-step workflow: constitution → specify → clarify → plan → tasks → implement. Supports 20+ AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Windsurf, etc.). Constitution-first approach with project principles guiding all decisions. Branch-per-feature, multi-artifact structure (spec, plan, tasks, research, contracts). Install: `uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git`

## [[moc-planning-work]] - Map of Content for Planning Tools

Overview of tools and approaches for planning software development with AI coding agents. Compares vibe coding vs detailed prompts vs spec-driven development. Covers [[openspec.dev]] (lightweight, universal) and [[github-spec-kit]] (structured, comprehensive). Includes decision matrix for when to use each approach.

## [[temporal-io-ai]] - Temporal for AI Orchestration

Temporal is the workflow orchestrator for AI applications and agents. Provides durable execution, state management, and failure handling out-of-the-box. Used by Replit, Retool, Gorgias for production AI systems. [[steve-yegge]] calls it "the Bagger 288 of workflow orchestrators" and believes it will be key for scaling AI workflows to enterprise level.
