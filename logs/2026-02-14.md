Alfred by David Szabo-Stuban (@ssdavid): Modded OpenClaw fork now fully portable. Deploys entire stack to Hetzner VM in 10 minutes with self-fixing deployment. Features: associative memory vault with HDBSCAN auto-clustering, relationship labeling via Cerebras/Llama 3.1, small language model training for <100ms retrieval, ontology-based knowledge organization. Built on LibreChat, n8n, Ghost, Cal.com, NocoDB. Self-fixes bugs automatically during deployment. "The value of AlfredOS is not the agent. It's the plumbing."
